 * <p>Link: <a href="https://www.naukri.com/code360/problem-of-the-day/easy?leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM">RiverFish</a></p>
 * Problem statement
 * There is a river which flows in one direction. One day, the river has 'N' number of fishes.
 * You are given an array 'FISHES' of integers representing the size of 'N' fishes.
 * The fishes are present in the river from left to right(0th index represents the size of the leftmost fish).
 * As the river flows from left to right so the fishes also swim from left to right.
 * The fishes are of different sizes and have different speeds.
 * The larger fishes are faster than the smaller fishes. Also,
 * larger fishes can eat smaller fishes but canâ€™t eat fishes of the same size.
 *
 * <p>Can you find the number of fishes that survive at the end of the day?</p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Let the size of fishes present in the river from left to right be{ 4, 2, 3, 1, 5 }.
 *
 * <p>1. As fish 4 is faster and bigger than fish 2, so fish 4 will eat fish 2.<p></p>
 * Remaining fishes: { 4, 3, 1, 5 }
 *
 * <p>2. As fish 3 is faster and bigger than fish 1, so fish 3 will eat fish 1. </p>
 * Remaining fishes: { 4, 3, 5 }
 *
 * <p>3. As fish 4 is faster and bigger than fish 3, so fish 4 will eat fish 3.</p>
 * Remaining fishes: { 4, 5 }
 * <p>Now fish 5 cannot eat fish 4, as fish 5 is faster than fish 4 and they swim from left to right.</P>
 * Thus, fish 4 will never reach fish 5.
 * <p>
 * Finally, we are left with only 2 fishes.
